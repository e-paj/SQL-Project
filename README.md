# Title: SQL Project (at the moment)
*Title will change when project is secured*

**Objective**: Expand SQL skills!!

**Aim**: Be more confident using SQL and more knowledgeable using it day-to-day.

**Project**: **unknown** (still looking for ideas online)

**Book**: To help me go through this project, I will use Walter Shields' *SQL Quickstart Guide* for guidance.

**Excel**: The excel sheet called *Book Inventory* will be the focus of this project. This sheet contains the books that I have. This was made on June 22, 2020 so it was not updated. I have bought new books that I would have to add as well. This is are just some of the task that I would like to do for this project.
