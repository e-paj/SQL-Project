# Title: Personal Book Inventory

**Objective**: Expand SQL skills!!

**Aim**: Be more confident using SQL and more knowledgeable using it day-to-day.

**Project**: Make a book inventory of the books I have. This would include title, author, year published, genre, location, and whether I have read it or not.

**Book**: To help me go through this project, I will use Walter Shields' *SQL Quickstart Guide* for guidance.

**Excel**: The excel sheet called *Book Inventory* will be the focus of this project. This sheet contains the books that I have. This was made on June 22, 2020 so it was not updated. I have bought new books that I would have to add as well. This is are just some of the task that I would like to do for this project. 

**Software**: For this project, I will be using *SQLite*. I originally thought of using Db2 by IBM, but the console seems to be not working. This is where most of my experience lies. Other softwares can be used as well.
