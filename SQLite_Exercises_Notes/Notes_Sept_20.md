## Notes in SQL Quickstart:

Sept. 21, 2021:
- **Views**: when a query is saved as a view, it can be called up as a subquery by selecting the view name. If any query is one we frequently use as a subquery, then establishing it as a view allows us to simplify our code and make what we are doing more transparent.

- **Subqueries**: one query nested inside of another query, usually in the SELECT, FROM, or WHERE clause. They are useful when the query we want to create requires a few additional steps or calculations to produce the dataset we desire.
