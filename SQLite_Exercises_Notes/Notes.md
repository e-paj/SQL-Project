## What I am doing in the exercises:

September 10, 2021:
- Using the same databases, make a comment line and comment block. 
- Make an alias for selected field names in a table. 
- Use the ORDER BY clause to order our results in a specific manner.
  - If we want to know how many NULL there are, use the ORDER BY (ascending order).
- Using LIMIT if we are not interested in seeing all the results. Or only wants to see specific number of results.
- Using Operators in conjunction with clauses. 
- Use the WHERE clause to add specific condition to our queries.

September 09, 2021:
- I downloaded SQLite to my desktop. 
- First activity is to download the databases necessary for the exercises. 
- Then open the databases on SQLite.
- First task is to make a simple SELECT statement using the *albums* table.
