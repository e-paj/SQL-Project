## What I'm doing in the exercises:

Sept. 14, 2021:
- OPERATORS:
  - IN operator: used to find a list of precise values. Also allows us to find specific values within a dataset.
  - = operator only allows to find only one value. IN allows many values which have to be separated by a comma wrapped in a parenthesis.
  - When using text as criteria in the WHERE caluse, the text value must be surrounded by single quotes.
  - Wildcard characters will always be enclosed in a single quotation marks.
