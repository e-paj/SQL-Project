- Getting the hang of SQLite. Just finishing as much of the exercises as much as possible.
🎉🎉

September 09, 2021:
- I have no choice but to change the software I used from Db2 of IBM Cloud to SQLite. For some reason, I could not open the console for Db2.
- At the moment, I am doing the exercises provided in the book. This is so by the time I actually start with the *Personal Book Inventory* project I am more confident in using SQL.
- No worries, the book isn't long (only 300 plus pages)!🥳
- Question is how I can share my work in the software to here??🤔

September 08, 2021:
- Ok, I made a decision that I would make a project about keeping track of the books I have. I thought of this as I already have made a list of the books I have. 
- I put this in Excel. This would include the author, genre, type of book, location, year published, and whether I read it or not.
- Interestingly, I forgot to add the title of the books (idk how this happened, but for some reason I did not put the title 🤷‍♀️).
- This would be one of the task to be done in the project: to put the title for each book!
- Tomorrow, the aim is to start the project. 👍
