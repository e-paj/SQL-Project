- Ok, I made a decision that I would make a project about keeping track of the books I have. I thought of this as I already have made a list of the books I have. 
- I put this in Excel. This would include the author, genre, type of book, location, year published, and whether I read it or not.
- Interestingly, I forgot to add the title of the books (idk how this happened, but for some reason I did not put the title 🤷‍♀️).
- This would be one of the task to be done in the project: to put the title for each book!
- Tomorrow, the aim is to start the project. 👍
